We can translate Benchmark1-1 in an alternative manner. Instead of manually asserting that start and end point to different memory addresses, we can instead leave this fact out. Then the formula becomes sat.

We translate as follows:
address(start) == a  # create a new pointer with some address a
1<=a<=512  # the address is a non-NULL memory location.

address(end) == b  # create a new pointer with some address b
1<=b<=512  # the address is a non-NULL memory location.

b == a + 2*8  # the address b is what you should expect a to be after two iterations.

start +p 2 == end  # after incrementing the pointer start by 2, it should now be asserted equal to end.

Expected result: sat.

Explanation: Using everything but the last line, we can deduce that address(start +p 2) == address(end) == b. In fact, this will be satisfied exactly when base(start) == base(end).
