We know that, in Benchmark1-2, we can satisfy if base(start) == base(end). However, we now wish to assert that it is possible to not satisfy.

We translate as follows:
address(start) = a  # create a new pointer with some address a
1<=a<=512  # the address is a non-NULL memory location.

address(end) = b  # create a new pointer with some address b
1<=b<=512  # the address is a non-NULL memory location.

b == a + 2*8  # the address b is what you should expect a to be after two iterations.

start +p 2 != end  # after incrementing the pointer start by 2, it should now be asserted not equal to end.

Expected result: sat.

Explanation: The instantiation start = (0, a), end = (1, a+2*8) is an example.
