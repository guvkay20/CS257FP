However, using pointer differences as in Benchmark 2-2 is not actually accurate. Pointer difference is only well-defined when the two pointers are related. Therefore, for the best accuracy, we actually need to specify the difference in the _addresses_. However, we still then need to specify that p_to_b and q are related pointers.

We assert:
address(p) != 0
address(p_to_b) != 0

address(p_to_b) - address(p) == 1
address(p_to_b) - address(q) == 1  # (This ensures address(p) == address(q).)
block(q) == block(p_to_b)

p != q

Expect: sat

Example solution: p = a, q = a, p_to_b = a+8, base(p) = 0 and base(q) = 1, for some choice of address 1<=a<=511.
