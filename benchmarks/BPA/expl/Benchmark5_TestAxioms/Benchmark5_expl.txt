Now we wish to directly test whether the pointer axioms were correctly instantiated.

==============

Benchmark 5-1:

Axiom A_in states that for all pointers, their address value lies between 0 and A. This axiom is instantiated for all subexpressions of sort Pointer.

We declare a pointer, then attempt to claim it's address is out-of-range. This should be unsat.

Declare pointer pt.
Declare int addr

We Assert:
addr = base(block(pt)) + offset(pt)

addr < 0 OR addr > 512
