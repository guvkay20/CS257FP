Benchmark 5-3+:

A_p states that a pointer created with the same block and address as p must equal p. A_a states that the address of a created pointer is the address it was created with, provided that the address was valid. A_b states that the block of a created poitner is the block it was created with, provided that the address was valid.

We therefore wish to test these three axioms directly for an instantiated p.

Declare pointer p.
For convenience, declare Int+ a
For convenience, declare Int b
For convenience, assert b = Block(p).

Here are a few statements:
(1) (Reduce a) == (Base b) + offset(p).
(2) 0 <= a <= 512.  # Becomes a Tautology

(3) (Create+ b a) == p.
(4) block(Create+ b a) == b.
(5) address(Create+ b a) == Reduce(a)

We can combine these in different combinations. We expect the following statements to be true:
(a): [DNE]
(b): 1 implies 3.
(c): 3 -> 1 ((Create+ b a), must have block b and address (Reduce a), and so it is functionally equal to any other pointer with this block and address.)

(d): 4 and 5 must be true. (This doesn't use anything about p. This is just a direct statement of A_a and A_b together.)
(e): We can_not_ have ~2 and 4. (This is because 2 is now guaranteed.)
(f): We cannot have ~2 and 5. (in fact we must have 2 and 5 now)
(g): We can no longer have ~1 and 5. (in fact, address(Create+ b a) must be Reduce(a))
